Versioned protocol:
- Make shim and the bootloaders using it express how enlightened they
  are to one another, so we can stop earlier without tricks like
  the one above
MokListRT signing:
- For kexec and hybernate to work right, MokListRT probably needs to
  be an authenticated variable.  It's probable this needs to be done
  in the kernel boot stub instead, just because it'll need an
  ephemeral key to be generated, and that means we need some entropy
  to build up.
New security protocol:
- TBD
kexec MoK Management:
Modsign enforcement mgmt MoK:
- This is part of the plan for SecureBoot patches.  Basically these
  features need to be disableable/enableable in MokManager.
Variable for debug:
- basically we need to be able to set a UEFI variable and get debug
  output.  Right now some code uses SHIM_VERBOSE but that needs a fair
  amount of work to actually be useful.
Hashing of option roms:
- hash option roms and add them to MokListRT
- probably belongs in MokManager
